## Introduction

This scalable solution provides a customized Amazon Q Business web application designed to help public sector agencies securely accelerate their adoption of Generative AI.

The application features **custom theming** for organizational branding and **automatic session management** that creates new **[anonymous chat sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/using-web-experience.html#web-experience-anonymous)** for each user visit.

By leveraging Amazon Q Business's [anonymous web experience URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl.html), the solution provides secure, temporary access without requiring user authentication.

## Reference Architecture

![Q Business with AWS Amplify Architecture](docs/images/q-business-with-aws-amplify-architecture-diagram.png)

Built with Express.js and deployed on AWS Amplify using CloudFormation for infrastructure management, this template creates a secure, themed Q Business deployment with the following components:

- **Q Business Application**: Anonymous access with custom theming
- **Web Experience**: Customized branding and styling
- **Amplify Hosting**: Server-side rendering with Express.js
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Security protection for the web application
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of Q Business configuration
- **S3 Bucket**: Theme assets (CSS, fonts, logos)
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege permissions for Amplify compute

## Amplify GitHub App Migration

After deployment, you may see this message in the AWS Amplify console:

![Amplify GitHub App Migration](docs/images/amplify-Migrate-to-our-GitHub-app-message.png)

**Recommendation**: Click the "Start migration" button to migrate to the new GitHub App integration. This provides improved security, better permissions management, and enhanced CI/CD capabilities for your Amplify deployments.
